# Introduction

*SophonEX - a commission-free crypto to crypto exchange, for the decentralized community.*

### Who we are

We are a group of programming geeks, previously working for Facebook, Google, KCG, JP Morgan, etc. "Digital natives" could be a pretty fit description for us. The majority of our founding team members are veterans of ACM-ICPC and TopCoder competitions, with great enthusiasm in coding, algorithm and mathematics.

When we first came across bitcoin's technical paper, we were fascinated by its engineering beauty and philosophy depth. From there, we start to imagine a decentralized world where trust doesn't comes with a charge, and trade doesn't comes with a commission.

### Why make SophonEX?

The time when we came to know and started researching on Bitcoin and cryptocurrency can be dated back to the mid of 2017. At the end of that year, we initiated a quantitative fund, focusing on the bitcoin arbitrage across different exchanges worldwide. Our fund size (prop + LP invested) is about 3000 BTC in maximum, and we traded across nearly 20 exchanges, including:
*BitFlyer, Coincheck, Quoinex(liquid), Zaif, Fisco, Binance, BitFinex, GDAX(coinbase pro), Gate.io(Bter), Huobi.Pro, OKEX, Poloniex, Kraken, Bithumb, Bitstamp, HitBTC*. We wrote the arbitrage and quant trading system mainly in C++ and javascript, and deployed it on multiple AWS ECs to colocate with these exchange servers. Our fund trading system is highly performant and reliable, making tens of thousands of orders per day. This high performance and reliability brings us to top 5 in terms of 24-hr volume in exchanges' ranking list.

Despite of the success, it is also due to the 10-month trading experience, we came to realize the facts that all the de facto crypto-crypto exchanges share several similar flaws:
- Digital Asset Security: hacking and security incidents happen every now and then;
- Clumsy and out-of-date backend architecture with poor engineering quality. E.g. most of the existing exchanges are written in old style PHP or J2EE or other stacks, which makes it hard to ensure high performance and reliability;
- APIs (restful and websocket) are badly designed and lagging. Based on our own experience, some of those APIs are being updated without prior announcements, which resulted in external trade bots mal-functioning occasionally;
- Most importantly, the trading commission is outrageously high. In traditional stock exchanges (e.g. Nasdaq, NYSE, etc) and the brokerage platforms (e.g. Charles Schwab, Scottrade, Interactive Broker, etc), the commission is typically charged at flat $0 ~ $6.95 [[Fees List]]( https://www.stockbrokers.com/guides/features-fees). Especially, a revolutionary product, [Robinhood](https://www.robinhood.com/) launched in 2013, brands itself as commission-free stock broker, which inspired us.

In light of this, we are dedicated to creating a brand-new crypto exchange with zero commission, high engineering quality and security by design. Although SophonEX is a centralized exchange, it's with the cutting-edge and up-to-date engineering standards. And we have a solid roadmap to gradually switch to a hybrid, and then fully decentralized exchange in the near future.

SophonEX project was kicked off in June 2018, and aims to officially launch in March 2019. Prelaunch registration is available now: [Priority access](https://land.sophonex.com/)
